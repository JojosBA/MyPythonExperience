# MyPythonExperience
I use this repository to document my experience with Python.
I'm a beginner in Python and GitHub. And I just want to say that I did most of the Code my self, but I did copied some lines of my code from the internet and from other GitHub users too. So thanks a lot to all the other friendly GitHub users who provide their Code.
