# MyPythonExperience
I use this repository to document my experience with Python.
I'm a beginner in Python and Github.
I just want to say that I did most of the Code my self but 
I did copied some lines of my code from the internet and from other Github users too.
So thanks a lot to all the other Friendly Github users who provide their Code.
